# Differences from Batect

Ratect is a from-scratch Rust implementation inspired by
[Batect](https://github.com/batect/batect) (which is itself no longer maintained — the
upstream repository was archived in October 2023), not a wrapper or fork. It does not
read Batect's documentation or source at runtime, and it does not (yet) support
everything Batect did. This page exists so you don't have to guess which Batect
behavior applies — if a field or flag isn't marked "Supported" below, or isn't in the
[config](config-reference.md)/[CLI](cli-reference.md) reference, assume Ratect doesn't
do it.

The tables below are the itemized detail behind the "Full Configuration Parity" and
"Full CLI Options Parity" entries in [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) — that file describes
direction, this page describes exact current status per field/flag, verified against
Batect's own reference documentation.

> **A note on unsupported fields**: Ratect's YAML parsing rejects unknown keys — if you
> write a Batect config field that Ratect doesn't understand (e.g. `working_directory`
> on a container), config loading fails with an error naming the field, rather than
> silently ignoring it. This means a config using any not-yet-supported Batect field
> won't load at all until that field is supported, even for fields marked "Not
> supported" in the tables below — there's no partial/best-effort mode.

## Configuration format

### Top-level fields

| Field | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `project_name` | Supported | |
| `containers` | Supported | See [Container fields](#container-fields) below. |
| `tasks` | Supported | See [Task fields](#task-fields) below. |
| `config_variables` | Supported | Only `default:` — no `description` field (rejected, per the note above; Ratect has no help/usage output to show one in anyway). See [config reference](config-reference.md#configvariable) and [Expressions](#expressions) below. |
| `include` | Supported, more restrictive | Both local **file includes** (splitting one project's config across files) and Git **includes/bundles** (importing shared tasks/containers from a separate Git repository, e.g. a team-wide `bundle.yml`) are supported — see [config reference](config-reference.md#includes). Any other `type` is rejected with a clear "not supported yet" error rather than silently ignored. Two known gaps versus Batect for Git includes: no 30-day cache eviction sweep, and no manual cache-clear CLI subcommand (Ratect has no subcommand structure yet to hang one off of) — `~/.ratect/incl` grows unbounded until removed by hand. **Deliberate divergence**: Ratect enforces that a Git include's `path`, and every `include` it transitively declares, stays within that repository's own clone directory (rejecting an absolute path, a `../..` traversal, or a symlink pointing back out) — see [config reference](config-reference.md#git-includes). Batect has no equivalent containment check (`IncludeResolver`/`PathResolver` both resolve an absolute `path` by discarding the base entirely, matching `java.nio.file.Path.resolve`'s own documented behavior, with no validation afterward beyond existence), so the same bundle that's rejected here would, in Batect, silently pull in an arbitrary file from the host running it. Local (non-Git) file includes remain unrestricted in both, by design, since those are always the project owner's own files. |
| `forbid_telemetry` | N/A | Ratect doesn't collect telemetry, so there's nothing to forbid. |

### Expressions

Not a single field — Batect supports an
[expression syntax](https://github.com/batect/batect.dev/blob/main/docs/reference/config/expressions.md)
(`$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}` for host environment variables; `<name`, `<{name}`
for config variables) usable *within* several fields: `environment`, `build_args`,
`build_directory`, `build_secrets.path`, `build_ssh.paths`, and volume local paths.

**Ratect implements this within `environment`, volume local paths, `build_directory`,
and `build_args`** (see [config reference](config-reference.md#expressions) for the
full syntax, precedence, and error rules, and
[Volume path resolution](config-reference.md#volume-path-resolution) for how an
interpolated host path — or `build_directory` — is then resolved relative to the config
file). Every other field's YAML string value is still used exactly as written, with no
host-side substitution step:

- `build_secrets.path` and `build_ssh.paths` are moot until those fields themselves
  exist — see their "Not supported" entries below.
- `run.command` is a field where you *will* see `$VAR`-style expansion happen — but
  that's ordinary POSIX shell variable expansion done by `sh -c` **inside the
  container**, using the container's own environment (including anything set via
  `environment`). It's unrelated to Batect's expression syntax, which substitutes
  values from the **host** before the container even starts.
- Batect has exactly one implicit built-in variable, `batect.project_directory`
  (the absolute path of the directory containing the config file), and Ratect
  supports it too — resolvable via `<batect.project_directory`/
  `<{batect.project_directory}` without being declared under `config_variables` (in
  fact, declaring or `--config-var`/`--config-vars-file`-overriding that exact name is
  a hard error, since it isn't meant to be overridable) — see
  [config reference](config-reference.md#built-in-config-variable-batectproject_directory).
  No other implicit/built-in variables exist beyond this one.

### Container fields

| Field | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `image` | Supported | |
| `volumes` | Partially supported | Only the `local:container[:options]` string form — see [config reference](config-reference.md#volume-path-resolution). The local path supports [expressions](#expressions). The expanded map form, [caches](https://github.com/batect/batect.dev/blob/main/docs/reference/config/containers.md#volumes), and tmpfs mounts aren't supported. |
| `dependencies` | Supported (simplified) | Starts recursively (nested dependencies too), on a network scoped to one task execution — see [the task lifecycle](task-lifecycle.md). No health-check waiting (`health_check` isn't parsed — see below) and no `setup_commands` support, so a dependency is "ready" as soon as it's started, unlike Batect's real readiness check. Works for dependency containers too, not just a task's own — see `build_directory` below. |
| `build_directory` | Supported (simplified) | Builds an image from a `Dockerfile` (always that exact name, at `build_directory`'s own root — no custom naming yet) — see [config reference](config-reference.md#image-building). A `.dockerignore` at the root is respected, with real Docker's actual matching rules (not `.gitignore`'s — see [`.dockerignore` semantics](config-reference.md#dockerignore-semantics)). No cross-invocation build caching or automatic image cleanup yet. |
| `additional_hostnames` | Supported | Extra network aliases beyond the container's own name — see [config reference](config-reference.md#container). No expression support (matching Batect, which doesn't support it here either). |
| `additional_hosts` | Supported | Extra `/etc/hosts` entries — see [config reference](config-reference.md#container). No expression support. |
| `build_args` | Supported | Values support [expressions](#expressions). |
| `build_target` | Not supported | |
| `build_secrets` | Not supported | |
| `build_ssh` | Not supported | |
| `capabilities_to_add` / `capabilities_to_drop` | Not supported | |
| `command` | Supported | Only at the container level via the equivalent task-level `run.command` — see [Task fields](#task-fields). |
| `devices` | Not supported | |
| `dockerfile` | Not supported | The Dockerfile is always named `Dockerfile`, at `build_directory`'s own root — no way yet to point at a differently-named or differently-located one. |
| `enable_init_process` | Not supported | |
| `entrypoint` | Not supported | |
| `environment` | Supported | Values support [expressions](#expressions) (host env vars and config variables). Combines with the equivalent task-level `run.environment` — see [Task run fields](#run-fields) and [config reference](config-reference.md#taskrun). |
| `health_check` | Not supported | This is why `dependencies` (above) treats "started" as "ready" instead of waiting for real health. |
| `image_pull_policy` | Not supported | Ratect always pulls an image at most once per run, with no `Always`-equivalent. |
| `labels` | Not supported | |
| `log_driver` / `log_options` | Not supported | |
| `ports` | Supported | Both the `local:container[/protocol]` string form (including port ranges) and the expanded `{local, container, protocol}` object form — see [Port mappings](config-reference.md#port-mappings). Validated (matching ranges, positive ports) at config-load time. |
| `privileged` | Not supported | |
| `run_as_current_user` | Supported | Runs the container as the host user's UID/GID instead of root, so files written to mounted volumes aren't root-owned — see [User mapping](config-reference.md#user-mapping). No equivalent to Batect's "cache mounts" (Ratect has no such config concept), and host-side uid/gid lookup is Unix-only. |
| `setup_commands` | Not supported | See `health_check` above — this is the other half of Batect's real dependency-readiness check that Ratect doesn't implement. |
| `shm_size` | Not supported | |
| `working_directory` | Not supported | |

### Task fields

| Field | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `run` | Supported, but **required** | Batect allows a task with only `prerequisites` and no `run`; Ratect requires `run` on every task. |
| `prerequisites` | Supported | No wildcard (`*`) matching — each name must be listed explicitly. |
| `dependencies` (task-level sidecars) | Not supported | Distinct from the container-level `dependencies` field above; not parsed at all. |
| `description` | Not supported | Rejected — see the note at the top of this page; `--list-tasks` output has no description column. |
| `group` | Not supported | Rejected — see the note at the top of this page; `--list-tasks` output isn't grouped. |
| `customise` | Not supported | |

### `run` fields

| Field | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `container` | Supported | |
| `command` | Supported | |
| `entrypoint` | Not supported | |
| `environment` | Supported | Values support [expressions](#expressions). Overrides the container's own `environment` on a key collision — see [config reference](config-reference.md#taskrun). |
| `ports` | Supported | Additional port mappings for this task's run, added to the container's own `ports` as a union — see [config reference](config-reference.md#port-mappings). |
| `working_directory` | Not supported | |

## CLI flags

Batect's full flag list, from its [CLI reference](https://github.com/batect/batect.dev/blob/main/docs/reference/cli.mdx):

| Flag | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--config-file` / `-f` | Supported | |
| `--list-tasks` / `-T` | Supported | No grouping or descriptions (see [task fields](#task-fields)) and no `--output=quiet`-style machine-parsable variant. |
| `--help` / `-h` | Supported | Auto-generated by `clap`. |
| `--version` | Supported | Auto-generated by `clap` (also gets a `-V` short form Batect doesn't have). |
| `<task-name> -- <args>` | Supported | Forwarded as `sh -c`'s positional parameters (`$1`, `$2`, `$@`) rather than appended as literal argv the way Batect does it — since Ratect always runs commands via `sh -c` (see [CLI reference](cli-reference.md#using-additional_args-in-a-task-command)), this is the safe equivalent within that design, though the exact mechanism differs from Batect's. |
| `--skip-prerequisites` | Not supported | Prerequisites always run. |
| `--override-image` | Not supported | |
| `--output` / `-o` | Not supported | Ratect has one output mode; see [how it works](how-it-works.md#5-logging-vs-output) for the stdout/stderr split it uses instead. |
| `--no-color` | Not supported | Ratect currently has no colored output to disable. |
| `--no-cleanup`, `--no-cleanup-after-failure`, `--no-cleanup-after-success` | Not supported | Ratect always attempts to remove containers after running; there's no way to leave them for debugging. |
| `--disable-ports` | Supported | Disables publishing of any container's `ports` to the host, regardless of config. |
| `--use-network` | Supported | Reuses an existing Docker network for every task in the invocation instead of creating a fresh one per task; never removed at cleanup, since Ratect didn't create it. See [task lifecycle](task-lifecycle.md). |
| `--enable-buildkit` | Not supported | Images are built via Docker's classic (non-BuildKit) build API — no way to opt into BuildKit. |
| `--tag-image` | Not supported | Built images are tagged `<project_name>-<container_name>` (like Batect's own default) — no way to additionally tag one with a custom name. |
| `--config-vars-file`, `--config-var` | Supported | See [CLI reference](cli-reference.md) and [Expressions](#expressions). |
| `--docker-host`, `--docker-context`, `--docker-config`, `--docker-cert-path`, `--docker-tls*` | Not supported | Ratect connects using Docker's local defaults only, with no CLI overrides. |
| `--cache-type`, `--clean`, `--clean-cache` | N/A | Moot — no cache concept exists (Batect's caches are for build performance, not implemented here). |
| `--max-parallelism` | N/A | Moot — Ratect doesn't run anything in parallel yet. Roadmap: [Parallel Task Execution](../ROADMAP.md#rust-enhancements). |
| `--no-proxy-vars` | Supported | Disables proxy environment variable propagation entirely — see [Proxy environment variables](config-reference.md#proxy-environment-variables). |
| `--log-file` | Different mechanism | Ratect uses `RUST_LOG` + stderr instead of a dedicated log-file flag — see [CLI reference](cli-reference.md#environment-variables). |
| `--no-update-notification`, `--upgrade`, `--no-wrapper-cache-cleanup` | N/A | Moot — Ratect isn't distributed via a self-updating wrapper script. |

## Runtime behavior gaps

Batect behavior not implemented in task execution, beyond what's covered by the field
tables above:

- **Interactive mode**: supported for the invoked task's own container (never a
  prerequisite's, a dependency's, or a sidecar's) when both Ratect's own stdin and
  stdout are real terminals — see [Interactive mode](config-reference.md#interactive-mode).
  Three things simplified relative to Batect: no live terminal-resize forwarding (synced
  once, at attach time, not tracked for the rest of the session), stdin forwarding
  isn't decoupled from TTY allocation the way Batect's is (Batect can pipe input into a
  task without allocating a TTY; Ratect gates both together), and the host's `TERM`
  isn't propagated into the container's environment (Batect's environment provider
  injects it alongside proxy variables, so full-screen terminal programs know the
  terminal type; set it explicitly via `environment` if a task needs it).
- **Parallel execution**: prerequisites run sequentially, not in parallel — Batect runs
  independent setup/cleanup steps concurrently.
- **Proxy support**: `http_proxy`/`https_proxy`/`ftp_proxy`/`no_proxy` are detected from
  the host environment and propagated into containers and builds automatically — see
  [Proxy environment variables](config-reference.md#proxy-environment-variables). The
  `localhost`-rewriting half of this only works on macOS/Windows (no automatic
  Docker-reachable hostname on Linux), and there's no Docker-version-gated hostname
  fallback chain the way Batect has for very old Docker installs — both accepted gaps,
  not worth chasing for any actively-maintained Docker daemon.
